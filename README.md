# riot-tagrouter
Riot js comes with a router along with the library file. This router however is purely imperitive and maintaining it in a large codebase can go out of hand pretty easily.

riot-tagrouter is a declarative wrapper around the same, it uses the same riot router in its core and auto starts the riot router upon its mount.
